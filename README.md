Minimal data sets used for autotuning and co-design in computer engineering
===========================================================================

Various public data sets for public bechmarks and kernels in CK format used 
in our research on universal and multi-objective autotuning/and crowd-tuning. 
It is possible to reproduce and extend some techniques from our recent papers:

* http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06256
* http://hal.inria.fr/hal-01054763
* https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00436029
* http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4075

Our eventual goal is to gradually release all our artifacts (code and data)
to help community reproduce and extend this research.
