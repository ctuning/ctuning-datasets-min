Minimal data sets used for autotuning and co-design in computer engineering
===========================================================================

Various public data sets for public bechmarks and kernels used
in our research on universal and multi-objective autotuning/crowd-tuning.
It is possible to reproduce and extend some techniques from our recent papers:

* http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06256
* http://hal.inria.fr/hal-01054763
* https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00436029
* http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4075

Our eventual goal is to gradually release all our artifacts (code and data)
to help community reproduce and extend this research.

======
Stable reprository

List of other CK data set repositories shared as zip
====================================================

It is possible to share CK repositories as zip archives (useful to share artifacts along with publications and add them as supplementary material for ACM Digital Library, for example). Such repositories can be installed via

 $ ck add repo:[repo_name] --zip=[zip archive name or full URL] --quiet

We shared multiple repositories with thousands of data sets for our shared benchmarks via Google Drive:

* https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-wXENVfIO82dzYwaUNIVElxaGc&usp=sharing 

List of other CK data set repositories shared via BitTorrent
============================================================

We share some large CK repositories in zip via BitTorrent to optimize sharing (upload and download) of such repositories across multiple users. We use the following file name convention for such repositories: ckr-<repo></repo>-YYYYMMDD.zip.

* ckr-32332f6412da1be1-20150803.zip (~287Mb) - Data sets (MiDatasets and cDatasets) from our past R&D to crowdsource autotuning and benchmarking (crowd-tuning and crowd-benchmarking).
